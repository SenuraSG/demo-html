            <td>Elephnt are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African
                bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant
                (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order
                Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include
                a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey
                skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which
                are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
                The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
                African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and
                convex or level backs.</td>

            <td>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its
                tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It
                is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
                lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
                been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

                The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild
                cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic
                period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been
                reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
                listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
                declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected
                areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
                are the greatest causes for concern.</td>

    <h2>DOG</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
                called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct gray wolves, and the gray wolf is the dog's closest
                living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that
                hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of
                agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
                individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
                canids.[4]

                The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
                physical attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for
                humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
                companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to
                human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on human
                society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</td>

    <h2>TIGER</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="th.jpg" alt="df"></td>
            <td>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera native
                to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail, and distinctive
                black, mostly vertical stripes on orange fur. It is traditionally classified into nine recent
                subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, namely mainland Asian tigers and island tigers of
                the Sunda Islands.

                Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and
                mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf
                forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on
                ungulates such as deer and wild boar, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and
                occupies home ranges, which it defends from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger
                overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he has reproductive claims. Females give birth to
                usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent,
                they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.

                Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are
                locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China, and on the islands of Java and Bali.
